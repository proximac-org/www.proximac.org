{"name":"Proximac","tagline":"Proximac enforces all applications working through proxy servers","body":"![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csujedihy/proximac/master/img/proximac-logo.png)\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nProximac is an command-line open-source alternative to Proxifier. With Proximac, it can force App to use SOCKS5 proxy. In the other words, it can forward any App's traffic to a certain SOCKS5 proxy. Moreover, Proximac now can forward all network traffic in your system to a proxy which means you may not need a VPN to do this job. I hope more developers can join this project.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n1. Support global traffic forwarding (VPN mode).\r\n2. Support SOCKS5 authentication using username/password.\r\n\r\nNote: Proximac only works on Mac OSX.\r\n\r\n### Install Proximac\r\n```\r\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/proximac-org/proximac-install/master/install.py |python\r\n```\r\n\r\nPaste that at a Terminal prompt.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n1. If you plan to use Proximac on OSX 10.10+, please run ```sudo nvram boot-args=\"debug=0x146 kext-dev-mode=1\"```. (Sorry, I do not have enough money to buy a developer membership to sign the kext)\r\n2. Run ```brew install libuv``` or whatever to install libuv that Proximac relies on\r\n\r\n### Usage \r\n1. Set up your config file which indicates Proximac's work mode (VPN or per-App) and proxy configuration\r\n2. Run ```proximac start [path of your config file]``` to start Proximac\r\n3. Run ```proximac stop``` to stop Proximac\r\n\r\n### An example of the config file\r\nWe use almost the same config file as shadowsocks do but add new arguments. (**Not in VPN mode**)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"process_name\":\r\n    [\"Unibox\", \"Google Chrome\", \"Thunder\"], \r\n    \"local_port\":1080,\r\n    \"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\r\n    \"proximac_port\":8558,\r\n    \"username\":\"foo\",\r\n    \"password\":\"bar\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote: \r\n\r\n***process_name*** are names of processes that you want to force to use SOCKS5 proxy, which can be found in ***Contents/MacOS*** folder inside those Apps (right click on Apps to get inside).\r\n\r\n***local_address*** and ***local_port*** is the ip address and the listen port of your SOCKS5 proxy, respectively. \r\n\r\nLeave ***proximac_port*** alone because this is now hardcoded in kext source. ***username*** and ***password*** are for SOCKS5 proxy required authentication if needed. If your SOCKS5 proxy does not require authentification, just remove these two lines.\r\n\r\nThere is another example (**VPN mode**)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"local_port\":1080,\r\n    \"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\r\n    \"proximac_port\":8558,\r\n    \"VPN_mode\":1,\r\n    \"proxyapp_name\":\"ShadowsocksX\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSet ***VPN_mode*** to 1 to enable VPN mode. \r\nSet ***proxyapp_name*** to your proxy's process name in case network traffic are trapped in a loop or we can call it a white-list but now Proximac only supports one proxy.\r\n\r\n### Contact:\r\ncsujedi at icloud dot com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
